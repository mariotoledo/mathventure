## Game Design

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
| Game Identity / Mantra:  | 2D RPG game with battle mechanics based on math problems |
| Design Pillars | Fast, Challenging, Smart |
| Genre/Story/Mechanics Summary | The player and controls a hero that earned the power of Newton and must battle monsters through an RPG system. Each dungeon is based on a different theme, such as sum, subtraction, multiplication, etc. When a player attacks a monster, each attack must be completed through an equation. Basic attacks are simple equations, but skills require more complex equations. |
| Features | Players must progress from stage to stage. Each stage contains a set of monsters which require the player to solve equations in a small amount of time. Stronger attacks require more complex equations to be solved. |
| Interface | Players must use the touch screen or the mouse as input. During battles, players will be able to choose options on the screen, and will have to type buttons with numbers on screen to give the solution to the equations. |
| Art Style | Game will be 2D, using free assets from the internet. It will have a medieval/fantasy style like Darkest Dungeon, and players will have a perspective from a side-scroller, such as StreetPass Quest from 3DS. |
| Music/Sound | Game will use free music assets from the internet. It will have a chill and cool music based on asian rpg or asian games, such as Gunbound and Mappe Story, or Dragalia Lost, in a way that the player feels in an adventure through a magical land. |
| Development Roadmap / Launch Criteria | Platform: PC.	Audience: 10-50, any gender, casual players |
